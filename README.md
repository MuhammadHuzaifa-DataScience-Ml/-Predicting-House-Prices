# House Price Prediction

This repository contains a project for predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. The project uses a dataset of house sales to build and evaluate multiple regression models and generate predictions.

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that performs data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation using various machine learning techniques. It uses several Python libraries to explore and analyze datasets, with a focus on:

- Data imputation
- Feature selection (Variance Inflation Factor)
- Model evaluation ( MSE, R²)

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `statsmodels`
- `scipy`
- `scikit-learn`

## Features

- **Data Imputation**: Uses both `SimpleImputer` and `IterativeImputer` to handle missing data.
- **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)**: Identifies multicollinearity in features and helps in feature selection.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates model performance using metrics such as accuracy, mean squared error, R², and F1-score.
